**FBBAUB: Fixed Budget Best Arm in Unimodal Bandits**

Our code can be divided into three significant steps:

**Step 1:** Use the file unimodal_expt.m to generate unimodal instances for four different experiments as given in the paper.

**Step 2:** 
(a) For each unimodal instance run the algorithms FBBAUB, LSE and Sequential Halving using the file FBBAUB_LSE_SeqHalv.m.

(b) For each unimodal instance run the algorithm Successive Reject using the file Successive Rejects.py.

**Step 3:** Use the file Error Probability Plot of FB-BAUB LSE SeqHav SR.py to generate the relevant plots as given in the paper.

**Note:** Store all the error probability values for each of the algorithms in the folder named **data/proberr**.
