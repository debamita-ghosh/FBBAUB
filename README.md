**FBBAUB-**

Our code can be divided into three major steps:

*Step-1*

Generate unimodal instances for four different experiments as given in the paper using the file xxx.py.

*Step-2*

Use the above generated unimodal instances to run the algorithms FBBAUB, LSE and Sequential Halving using the file yyy.m.

Use the above generated unimodal instances to run the algorithms successive rejects using the file zzz.py.

*Step-3*

Use the file to generate the relevant plots as given in the paper.

**Note**

Store all the error probabilty values for each of the algorithms in the folder named as data/proberr
